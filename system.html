                    <p>
                        <strong>PAUL</strong> (Pole Automaton Using Ultraviolet Light) is a pole climbing robot designed to disinfect poles in public transport via a band of low wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVC).
                        <br>
                        PAUL is designed to work alongisde professional cleaners to aid in cleaning public transport. We view this as especially relevant as during the pandemic, but our modular design facilitates other use cases as well.

                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lh6aEMTPd1g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>
                        <strong style="font-size:18pt;">Use Cases</strong><br>
                        <strong>1. Disinfection</strong><br>
                        PAUL is designed primarily for sanitising poles on public transport. The aim is to frequently disinfect poles as they are highly touched surfaces.
                        After being attatched to the pole. The UI offers control over speed, emission of UV light and the duration of cleaning cycles.
                        During cleaning, the robot moves at a slow, constant speed, and the attached UV module emits short wavelength ultraviolet light for virus deactivation.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>2. General Purpose Pole Climber </strong><br>
                        When the UV module is removed, PAUL becomes an automated pole-climber. Allowing other modules that can replace the UV module to achieve other functionality, or work alongside it. (see Future Development section below)
                    </p>


                <h3 class = "display-1">Functionality</h3>
                <strong style="font-size:22pt;">Features</strong><br>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. Automatic Movement and Disinfection</strong>
                        <br>
                        PAUL can move up and down automatically after setup using our web app. The onboard distance sensors detect potential collisions and turn PAUL around.

                        <br><br>
                        <strong>2. Authentication</strong>
                        <br>
                        Only the authenticated user can login and control PAUL.

                        <img src="images/login.png" alt="Porter’s Five Forces Analysis" width="800" height="800"><br>
                        <strong>3. Adjustability</strong>
                        <br>
                        The user can toggle UV mode, Auto mode, and set work hours as well speed of PAUL. 
                        These features are supported by a range of accessibility features. The user can toggle on/off High Contrast, Narrator, Magnifier, Light Mode and Vibrations.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="images/setting.png" alt="Porter’s Five Forces Analysis" width="800" height="800"><br>
                        <strong>4. Centralised Management</strong>
                        <br>
                        Users can control multiple PAUL robots from their account on our web app. Allow the user to adjust many robots at once.
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="images/control.png" alt="Porter’s Five Forces Analysis" width="800" height="800"><br>
    
                        
                        <br>
                        <strong style="font-size:22pt;">Why PAUL?</strong><br>
                        <strong>1. Easy to Use</strong>
                        <br>
                        Users can control PAUL easily by a simple, intuative web app. Connecting to PAUL via wifi with the help of the onboard Raspberry Pi.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>2. Efficient Disinfection</strong>
                        <br>
                        Whole-room disinfection experiences a number of issues, PAUL's design overcomes these by focusing on a specific area which is likely to result in virus transmission.
                        Allowing for more effective and more frequent cleaning of highly touched poles.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>3. Effective Design</strong>
                        <br>
                        The design of PAUL overcomes traditional problems with UV cleaning. It limits the cleaning area, emits light at a close distance,
                        and maintains a constant light intensity –– all allowing stable and highly focused UV irradiation towards the pole. Unlike other competitors
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>4. Safety</strong>
                        <br>
                        PAUL only operates when the train reaches the end of a journey and there are now humans present. Due to <a href = "https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/uv-radiation.html"> <U>the damaging nature of UVC radiation.</U> </a>
                        Our UV enclosure also provides an added layer of protection.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>5. Cheaper</strong>
                        <br>
                        PAUL currently only costs us £381 to produce and we expect to be able to reduce this further. Our main competitors Hipac and UVD Robotics produce robots which
                        cost £36k and £58k respectively. 
                    </p>
                <h3 class = "display-1">Market Research</h3>
                    <p class = "market_research">
                        <strong style="font-size:18pt;">Background</strong><br>
                        During the pandemic, the risk of infection on public transportation is high.
                        One of the primary means of virus transmission is through high-touch surfaces on which viruses can survive for a long period of time.
                        There does not currently exist any product on the market to repetitively disinfect such surfaces during the operation of buses and trains.
                        We therefore propose an automatic UV cleaning robot for poles to a supplement existing cleaning staff.

                              Ultimately, we are very happy that we have a compelling product, able to deliver on the need for more consistent cleaning solution on public transport.
                              There are many opportunities to continue improving PAUL’s functionality. Finally, we have taken steps to minimise the
                              ethical / health concerns by operating only on trains which are not in-transit and believe we could overcome supplier concerns by indentifying multiple suppliers and entering negotiations early.

                        <ul>
                            <b>The Situation</b>
                            <li>The disinfection of high-touch areas is important as COVID-19 virus “can survive for <b>72 hours</b> on metal and plastics”
                              (<a href="https://www.pplpro.co.uk/uv-c-surface-disinfection/" target="_blank" title="PP-L Technology"><U>PP-L Health Technology Solutions</U></a>).</li>
                            <li>For most trains and buses, touch points are now sanitized more frequently but manually by having dedicated staff to work around the clock.
                              As “<a href="https://www.railinsider.co.uk/2020/10/02/lner-cleaners-have-worked-307000-hours-since-march/" target="_blank" title="Rail Insider"><U>LNER cleaners have worked <b>307,000 hours</b></U></a>” from March to October, 2020,
                              it suggests that <b>automatic cleaning robots would have a market in helping to ease cleaners’ workload and reduce their infection risks</b>.</li>
                            <li>There have been <b>more than 200 UV devices installed</b> to sanitise escalator handrails continuously across the London Underground network, in addition to applying the disinfection methods in the TfL's cleaning regime.
                              (<a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-19-faqs/how-public-transport-being-cleaned" target="_blank" title="How is public transport being cleaned?"><U>london.gov.uk</U></a>)</li>
                            <li>Pole cleaning can potentially be automated for Lothian Buses to achieve more frequent and effective disinfection.
                              Currently all their vehicles are “cleaned externally and internally on a <b>daily basis</b>, […] including more enhanced cleaning of the main customer touch-points such as <b>hand poles</b> and grab rails and our driver cab areas”

                            <li>We have identified some potential competitors. At present, however, most UV disinfection robots are for whole-room treatment, such as the <a href="https://www.hipac.com.au/shop/uvc-disinfection-robot/index" target="_blank" title="Hipac"> <U>Hipac disinfection robot</U> </a>,

                              These large robots, as well as small hand-held UV disinfection devices such as the <a href="https://www.pro-lab.co.uk/product/bio%e2%80%a2wand-uv-sanitiser/" target="_blank" title="Bio Wand"><U>Bio-Wand sanitiser</U></a>, which have <b>different purposes than PAUL</b>.</li>
                            <li>While the larger UV disinfection robots mentioned above cost around <b>£40,000</b>, PAUL is competitive not only for that it's the only robot on the market which will provide its functionality, but also for a much cheaper price.</li>

                        <ul>
                          <li>We are in a good position for horizontal scaling, having already prepared authentication scripts and a web UI which supports accounts with many robots.</li>
                          <li>Currently, each pole will employ their own PAUL to achieve disinfection. For now, PAUL will only operate when there are no humans in the area, at the end of a given route.
                            In future we leave open the possibility of expanding PAUL’s functionality to allow for operation during transit, improving commercial viability but including many ethical and design constraints.</li>
                          <li>Start to develop relationships with procurement officers at train companies operating in Scotland e.g. Scotrail, Crosscountry, etc.</li>
                          <li>Start negotiating with suppliers in order to minimise our dependency on any given supplier and improve our negotiating position when buying in bulk whilst minimising production downtime.</li>

                        <strong>1. After the pandemic</strong>
                        <br>
                        After the pandemic is over, PAUL can be adapated for other use cases by simply replacing the UV module with other modules.
                        For example, it can be equipped with a camera system to inspect street poles for damage (such as power cables on top of the pole).
                        This will allow workers to inspect poles safely and only have to work high-up when damage is detected by the robot.
                        Hence, poles can be inspected quicker and more frequently as workers can easily deploy the robot up the pole.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>2. Safety Features for Operation in Transit</strong>
                        <br>
                        To operate PAUL when the bus/train is in transit with passengers close to the UV module, more rigorous safety features should be added to reduce the chance of human exposure.
                        <ul style="margin-top:0;">
                          <li>Motion sensors can be used to detect if anything is moving towards or around it, and allow it to carry out corresponding actions – produce alarms and turn off the UV lights
                            – to ensure that any attempt to touch the robot body will not result in exposure to UV.</li>
                          <li>Proximity sensors can be used to give warnings when it finds anything within a set distance.</li>
                          <li>Locks on wheels for PAUL to grip tightly onto the pole whenever it is stopped can protect it against some unexpected disturbance caused by passengers, especially children.</li></ul>
