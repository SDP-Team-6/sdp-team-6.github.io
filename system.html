                <h3 class = "display-1">Concept</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is absolutely vital to sanitise and disinfect public surfaces.

                        One of the most popular fomites is the poles people used to hold on to on public transport.
                        <strong>PAUL</strong> is built to conveniently sanitise poles of public transport by moving vertically and disinfecting them with UV Light.
                    </p>


                <h3 class = "display-1">Why PAUL?</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>1. Automatic Moving and Disinfecting</strong>
                        <br>
                        After PAUL is activated through the app's command, it can move up and down automatically, and the UV emitter will be turned on to disinfect the pole.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>2. Safety</strong>
                        <br>
                        Our primary competitor in the market would be UVD Robots, who themselves produce large robots which use UVC technology to clean entire rooms at a time.

                        However, our competitor is only able to deploy their robots when no humans are present due to

                        <a href = "https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/uv-radiation.html"> <U>the damaging nature of UVC radiation.</U> </a>
                        In this case, PAUL encloses the UV emitter by a safety case.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>3. Easy to Use</strong>
                        <br>

                        Users can control PAUL easily by a simple app. It connects PAUL via wifi with the help of a Raspberry Pi.

                        <br><br>
                        <strong>4. Cheaper</strong>
                        <br>
                        PAUL is much cheaper than other UV disinfecting robots in market. (Specific information can be implemented after market research)

                    <p>

                        <strong style="font-size:18pt;">Background</strong><br>
                        During the ongoing pandemic, the risk of infection for taking public transportation is high due to the transmission nature of coronavirus.
                        One of the primary means of virus transmission is through high-touch surfaces on which viruses can last a long period of time.
                        Means to repetitively disinfect such surfaces during the operation of buses and trains is lacking in the market.
                        We therefore propose an automatic UV cleaning robot for poles – where passengers may often touch and get viruses inattentively –
                        as a supplement to the various general disinfection products that currently exist.

                              which achieves 99.9% disinfection under controlled lab conditions.</li>

                        <strong>Remould after pandemic</strong>
                        <br>

                        After pandemic finish, PAUL can be remoulded for other use cases.

                        For example, it can be equipped with a camera and used to inspect street poles for damage.
                        This will allow workers to inspect poles from the safety of the group and only have to work high-up when damage is detected by the robot.
                        This will allow street poles to be inspected quicker and more frequently as workers can easily deploy the robot up the pole.
