# website


Here lies the repository for Group 6's marketing website for PAUL. PAUL is a pole climbing robot designed to disinfect poles in public transport via a band of low wavelength ultraviolet radiation.

This website was made with vanilla web development tools such as HTML, CSS, & a wee bit of JavaScript. We used [Styleshout's](https://www.styleshout.com/) template as a starter plate and modified it heavily to match our requirements.


Made with ❤️ by PAUL's Web Development Team for the [System Design Project](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cxinfr09032.htm) Course.
