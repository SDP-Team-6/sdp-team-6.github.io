                        The main focus of the team this week was on improving the Webots Simulation and working towards getting a working version of the Hardware prototype.

                    <p>
                        The hardware team coordinated with the technicians to build a LEGO casing for PAUL and attach the motors into the case. They took the decision to use a Raspberry Pi over an Arduino as the technicians advised this would allow us to work remotely more easily. They also followed the tutorial and managed to connect to the Raspberry Pi called Pikachu and run the motors successfully.

                    <p>
                        The software team met with the Webots Expert to discuss the best practices for simulating friction in webots.
                        Yasmin conducted research into UVC cleaning which gave us a great deal of knowledge of how to best design our UV module.
                        Stirling and Gagan attended the Quantitative Analysis workshop on behalf of the team and will use what they learned in the next demo report.

                    <p>
                        We had our weekly meeting on Thursday, where we discussed what each team had been working on, heard about the QA workshop and looked at the UVC research by Yasmin. We plan to keep working during flexible learning week and the technicians also said they would be working.

                    This week our team attended several workshops and presentations hosted
                    by the SDP staff and we learnt more about the logistics of the course
                    and met a lot of people. Our team had three meetings across the week
                    and it mainly revolved around choosing a project, learning LaTeX and
                    WeBots. Our team worked smoothly on the logistics of everything like
                    setting up GitHub, Doodle Polls, Teams, and the Trello Board. For the
                    next week we plan to work on our project plan report, get to know our
                    team, and write our project plan. This week wasn't challenging but 
                    was very demanding as we had a lot of workshops and presentations to
                    attend. Overall, everyone was quite engaging and goals were achieved 
                    productively.
