                    This is our first of our 11 blogs we've planned for this course. 
                    We took several approaches to reflect from on work and improve as we move along, 
                    and writing this blog is one of them.

                    Over the weekend we decided that we wanted to change our project idea after we 
                    decided our original idea wasn't feasible. In our first meeting we decided
                    on a new robot idea which would be used to disinfect poles on public transport
                    using ultraviolet light.

                    The main focus of this week of development was preparing our software simulation for our upcoming demonstration. We used our project plan and tasks decided upon therein to highlight our priority areas.
                    We had a meeting to discuss what subtasks would be allocated to each person in the simulation team.

                    We started the week by working on the demo one report and video. 
                    The Project management team were making final edits to the video and the report.
                    Everyone met up on monday to discuss what changes were required and made a quality check to see if we missed something,
                    finally Daniel submitted the report and we all called it a day!

                    The main focus of the team this week was on improving the Webots Simulation and working towards getting a working version of the Hardware prototype.
                    The hardware team coordinated with the technicians to build a LEGO casing for PAUL and attach the motors into the case.
                    They took the decision to use a Raspberry Pi over an Arduino as the technicians advised this would allow us to work remotely more easily.

                <p>
                    The Hardware team continued to work with the technicians and ran the hardware prototype for the first time.
                    Generally, we tried to take this opportunity to reflect on how we were progressing towards our goals and took some time to focus on other work before getting back to PAUL in the coming weeks.

                    This week we found out we won't have access to Appleton Tower for the rest of the 
                    semester. This sucked caused most of our team was in Edinburgh, and we won't be
                    able to meet to work on our project together nor will the hardware team will be able to
                    work on building the prototype by themselves and had to rely on Garry for the rest of
                    the course.

                    During this week our work focused primarily on preparing to participate in a peer review with another group.
                    Fortunately, this group was also working with UV technology and had been experiencing similar hardware difficulties,
                    we found this reassuring and useful as we were able to exchange usual information about potential issues with development.

                    Members of the Front-End team attended the Usability workshop to help them better understand the features
                    they should add to the Website and Web-based User Interface.

                    At the start of the week we discussed the possibility that the Hardware prototype might not be fixed in time for the demo and as a contingency the Software Team started working towards making a Train environment simulation for the demo video.

                    The group then attended the Q&A on Wednesday to receive feedback from our client.
