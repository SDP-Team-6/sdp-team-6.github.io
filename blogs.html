                </h3>
                <p>
                    This is our first of our 11 blogs we've planned for this course. 
                    We took several approaches to reflect from on work and improve as we move along, 
                    and writing this blog is one of them.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Over the weekend we decided that we wanted to change our project idea after we 
                    decided our original idea wasn't feasible. In our first meeting we decided
                    on a new robot idea which would be used to disinfect poles on public transport
                    using ultraviolet light.

                    Week 3: The Simulation Push
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The main focus of this week of development was preparing our software simulation for our upcoming demonstration. We used our project plan and tasks decided upon therein to highlight our priority areas.
                    We had a meeting to discuss what subtasks would be allocated to each person in the simulation team.
                    By Friday, we had successfully managed to implement a rudimentary robot design that was able to climb the poll as we had envisioned; additionally managing to achieve successful implementation of distance sensors by Sunday. 
                    Our front-end team during this time also ensured that the skeleton of the website had been prepared and was undertaking research regarding best practices for implementation of the web UI.
                    The team undertook individual study to familiarise themselves with relevant technologies.
                    Our hardware team leveraged this time to translate our ideas into a working prototype. Creating models and meeting with experts to facilitate this.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    We started the week by working on the demo one report and video. 
                    The Project management team were making final edits to the video and the report.
                    Everyone met up on monday to discuss what changes were required and made a quality check to see if we missed something,
                    finally Daniel submitted the report and we all called it a day! 
                    The team met again on tuesday to discuss wednesday's meeting and had a practice Q&A session with our client & mentor.
                    The Front-end team discussed usability & accessibility issues, the hardware & the software team brainstormed different edge cases in a practical setting. 
                    On wednesday, we finally met with our client Steve and discussed our next steps, and it revolved around the ethics and accessibility issues of our robot. 
                    It gave us a new perspective on how we can improve upon our next demo. 
                    Finally, our team met once again on thursday to discuss our tasks for the next few weeks.
                    Project managers made new tasks on trello, and other team members joined the tasks they were interested in.
                    Software team scheduled a meeting with the front-end team to work on the software part.
                    After this, everyone independently worked on their part.

                    Week 5: Pikachu
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The main focus of the team this week was on improving the Webots Simulation and working towards getting a working version of the Hardware prototype.
                    The hardware team coordinated with the technicians to build a LEGO casing for PAUL and attach the motors into the case.
                    They took the decision to use a Raspberry Pi over an Arduino as the technicians advised this would allow us to work remotely more easily.
                    They also followed the tutorial and managed to connect to the Raspberry Pi called Pikachu and run the motors successfully. 
                    The software team met with the Webots Expert to discuss the best practices for simulating friction in webots.
                    Yasmin conducted research into UVC cleaning which gave us a great deal of knowledge of how to best design our UV module.
                    Stirling and Gagan attended the Quantitative Analysis workshop on behalf of the team and will use what they learned in the next demo report.
                    We had our weekly meeting on Thursday, where we discussed what each team had been working on, heard about the QA workshop and looked at the UVC research by Yasmin.
                    We plan to keep working during flexible learning week and the technicians also said they would be working.

                    The Hardware team continued to work with the technicians and ran the hardware prototype for the first time.
                    Generally, we tried to take this opportunity to reflect on how we were progressing towards our goals and took some time to focus on other work before getting back to PAUL in the coming weeks.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    During this week our work focused primarily on preparing to participate in a peer review with another group.
                    Fortunately, this group was also working with UV technology and had been experiencing similar hardware difficulties,
                    we found this reassuring and useful as we were able to exchange usual information about potential issues with development. 
                    The software team during this period focused primarily on implementing a Webots API that would allow us to use the same overarching controller on both hardware and simulation versions,
                    accessing the appropriate API. The hardware team worked closely with technicians to resolve issues with the physical robot.
                    They installed the bump and IR sensors and conducted testing on these sensors. 
                    We also began to shift our focus away from the development of the robot briefly in order to prepare for our demonstration by conducting quantitative analysis and polishing any features which we had implemented following the last demo

                <p>
                    This week we focused on getting the hardware prototype ready for the demo and starting work on a Web UI.
                    Members of the Front-End team attended the Usability workshop to help them better understand the features they should add to the Website and Web-based User Interface.
                    They drew up wireframes for the Web UI and received feedback on these from the Usability Expert.
                    The hardware team worked on the UV module which was successfully installed.
                    They tested the climbing of the robot with the UV module attached to ensure that the added weight did not impact this.
                    They encountered some issues with the LED which they intend to fix next week after the demo.
                    We had our weekly meeting on Thursday, we heard the progress of each team,
                    discussed the progress towards writing the report and ideas for the demo video.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    This week we focussed towards trying to get a working hardware prototype, refining the design of the Web UI and creating a train environment in webots.
                    At the start of the week we discussed the possibility that the Hardware prototype might not be fixed in time for the demo and as a contingency the Software Team started working towards making a Train environment simulation for the demo video.
                    We would use this Train environment to simulate cleaning poles PAUL inside a train carriage as this is one of the Use Cases we see for PAUL.
                    The Front-End team started adding content to the website so that we have a head start for the website deadline next week.
                    They also provided a walkthrough of how to use the website for the user guide and demo video.
                    The hardware team worked to resolve the hardware issues with the prototype but ran into a myriad of issues.
                    They attended the tech-live lab session each day this week from 12-5pm but were unable to resolve all the hardware issues before the week ended.
                    This means that we don't have a working hardware prototype for the demo next week but we hope to keep working next week and get it fixed in time for the industry day.
                    They met with our client Steve on Thursday to discuss the hardware issues and check that he was happy with our plan to use webots footage in the video in place of hardware footage.
                    We had to reschedule our weekly meeting as a few of the group members were not able to attend on Thursday.
                    We met on Saturday instead and discussed what each team had worked towards,
                    informed the entire team about the hardware issues and the plan for getting the report done.

                    This week we are focussing on getting the website completed and preparing for the industry day on Friday.
                    We started the week off by submitting the demo 4 report, user guide, video and poster for our booth at the Industry day.
                    The group then attended the Q&A on Wednesday to receive feedback from our client. 
                    The front-end then coordinated the completion of the website and used members from all teams to assist with its completion.
                    The hardware team attended the tech-live labs from Tuesday to Thursday in an effort to resolve the hardware issues.
                    Finally, we will attend the Industry Day tomorrow as a team to receive feedback from a panel of judges.
